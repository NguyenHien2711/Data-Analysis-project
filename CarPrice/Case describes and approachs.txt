Project1 Analysis the features influence Car Price
Welcome to my repository
Iâ€™m learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by March of 2023
This project aims to build a linear regression model to identify and evaluate the primary features which have substantial impact on Car Price through Python Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, Sklearn.
The detail steps to approach the cases is
1. Overview
- Acquire some basic knowledge about data, how the various features are distributed and whether there are missing values, untreated format data. 
- Subdivide variables into 2 types concluding categorical and numerical features, this process help to check distribution (apply describe() function) 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Univariate Descriptive Statistics
  + Analysis each feature in more detail 
  + Graphically approach
    + Hisplot and kdeplot to identify how data is distributed (normal distribution, skew distribution) 
    + Boxplot to check outliers of numerical variables
    + Countplot visualize frequency of values 
- Bivariate analysis 
  + Numerical lmplot, heatmap and pearson to check relationship between independent features and dependent features 
  + Categorical Violinplot to visualize how categorical variables affect price
3. Data Preprocessing 
- Feature Selection Filter selection through check correlation (criteria 0.7)
- Split Dataset in to Data train set and data test set
- Feature Scaling Check which type of feature scaling technique is optimal to apply for dataset
- Apply feature scaling for training set and test set 
4. Build model and evaluate model
- Build OLS model
- Calculate R squared, mean_squared_error and accuracy_score

Welcome to my repository!<p>
I’m learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by March of 2023<p>
This repository have been created with intention to practise and showcase my skillsets.<p>
# Case study description <br>
**Description:** Geely Auto is a leading automobile manufacturer based in Hangzhou that plans to expand business to the American market through establishing manufacturing factories with ambition to win against both domestic and European competitors in the US market. <p>

**Code**: [Analyse the features influence Car Price](https://github.com/NguyenHien2711/Data-Analysis-project/tree/main/CarPrice) <pr>

# A. Approach 

# B. Summary result 
### 1.Market overview
Suppose: According to price classification, we could necessarily subdivide the competitors into 3 groups including luxurious car brands having price more than $20000, ordinary car brands having price less than $20000 and over $12000, and the cars having price under $12000 were grouped into lower car brands. 
The histogram graph shows the frequency of car prices and the pie chart describes the proportion of car types in 3 kinds of car brands classified by price in the US market. 
Looking from an overall perspective, in the US automobile market, the car price is apparently diverse  and present in many segments. 
The average price of a car is about $13277, ranging from over $5000 to around $45400. 
Americans seem to have high-demand for lower car prices,  accounting for the majority percentage of the total car, at around 58.5%, the figure for medium price and luxury price were considerably lower, at approximately 29,8% and 12.7%.
